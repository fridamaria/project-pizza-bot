# What is this
The first pair programming assignment during the Technigo bootcamp. 
Assignment: **Build a Pizza Bot**.

## How We started
We had separately done the weekly assignments and watched all the video material to prepare for the Pizza bot project. We felt as if the structure of the project was so thorough that we didn't make a separate  plan for the javascript code. We swapped driver/navigator according to the iterations in the project guide. 
 
### What We struggled with and should improve for next pair programming project
We both feel as if we should have had a timer and take small breaks through out the day. We took longer breaks for meals and such, but an additional smaller breaks would have been good. 

For next time this is something both of us will suggest to whoever our partner will be. 

### What We're proud of
TEAMWORK, we complemented each other well. We had som issues with the form at first but we managed to figure it out and be able to save the input from the user on the web page. 

Christina is super proud over Frida and the fact that she did the CSS by herself during the evening, even tho we said that we where gonna call it a day!

Frida is super proud over Christina and that she took time to explain the javascript parts in a pedagogical way, having peeked at the instructions beforehand!

## If We had more time
We would have done some cleaning in the CSS and would have liked to try to toggle so the second label and input was visible first after entering what kind of pizza the customer wanted.
